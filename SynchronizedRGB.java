//Oracle的例子中讲述按照以下规则, 将SynchronizedRGB类变成不可变类

//1.Don't provide "setter" methods ― methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields.
//2.Make all fields final and private.
//3.Don't allow subclasses to override methods.
//The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final.
//A more sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods.
//4.If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed:
//A>Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.
//B>Don't share references to the mutable objects.
//Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor;
//if necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies.
//Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objects when necessary to avoid returning the originals in your methods.
